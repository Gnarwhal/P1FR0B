Welcome to DotaPack!

Despite the name, DotaPack is no longer purely a DotA 2 server.
Roles in this server are meant to show which games you are interested in playing with people, you can manage your roles by going to #bot-messages and reacting with the roles that you want, you can also do the same to remove roles that you have.

Feel free to @ a role if you want to get a game going, the "Something" role is meant for if you don't have a specific game in mind.

This is P1FR0B, the game coordinator, a bot with a bunch of random functions. If there are any issues or suggestions, feel free to contact .Varas
