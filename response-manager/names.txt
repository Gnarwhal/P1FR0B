Where have all the good wars gone? The Stygian Conquests, the Wightfall Invasion... the centuries-long campaigns against the the forces of the Continuum... Battles that mattered, had consequence.

Today's war is...tedium. The same fight in a different trench. Each stake smaller than the last. But there's a great war
